This is a random collection of my study tips from the Security+ exam. I was so scared to take this exam and spent over a year studying. These resources are from sending to friends back in 2015 (I updated the links to 2020), and maybe someone out there could use a little push too.

* Studying should not be a cram session, don’t burn your self out. Take your time, and integrate small sessions as best as you can into your day-to-day life. For Example: Use your time where you are waiting in line and would be checking Twitter or playing phone games to study on your phone.
* Common TCP/UDP ports were a struggle for me, I made flash cards for them. Get a bunch of index cards and write the port number on one side and a blurb about the service on the other side, keep them at your desk and drill yourself on them. Ones that you get wrong put in a separate pile and drill yourself again, rinse and repeat until you have got them all right. Wait a month and see if you remember.
* [Get practice questions and exam objectives from CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security#examdetails) (free but gotta fill out a marketing form).
* Use the [CompTIA Certmaster Practice App](https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-practice) (kind of expensive/over-priced).

* [Get Professor Messer’s study guide and practice tests pdfs](https://www.professormesser.com/sy0-501-security-plus-success-bundle/) (costs money but worth it) or his Security+ YouTube [Playlist 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnkcKd71N4OjSv4cUXNhoPlQ) & [Playlist 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlhMM1KV5ST1qi3kI87hMpY) (both free). He also has [study group videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnkijp3VBQ5CPf19bK-5hmec) on his YouTube which go over practice questions.
* Go through Cybrary.it content such as [practice exam study guide](https://www.cybrary.it/study-guides/free-security-exam-study-guide/), and [video series](https://www.cybrary.it/course/comptia-security-plus/) (all free but requires an account).
* Use [Crucial Exams free practice exams](https://crucialexams.com/exams/comptia/security+/sy0-501/) which you can get as an [android app](https://crucialexams.com/download-the-app/) as well (all free).
* There are other android apps that are user made or small company made (freemium/ads) just search Security+ or SY0-501 in the play store.
* There are PDFs that cost money that people are providing for free. They’re typically breaking licensing agreements or terms of use by sharing it so I wont link them here, but you may find some with some Google digging. 

Finally here are some tips a friend gave me from her trainer that I found helpful:

1. DON’T CRAM the night before!….all this does is cloud your head with too much information to process correctly in the ~90 minutes you have to take the exam.
1. EAT BRAIN FOOD the night before. I like to say that Salmon is a good idea…but really any fish is good for that.
1. TRY to get a good night of sleep. I know that you will be worried about the exam, but YOU REALLY NEED some sleep for your brain to work optimally. 
1. EAT SOMETHING before you take the exam (whether it is breakfast or lunch, depending on when your exam is that day). NOT a heavy meal, but enough that your brain has fuel.
1. Know IN ADVANCE, where the exam center is at. Know IN ADVANCE how long it should take you to get there….and add 15-20 minutes to that time (unless you live or work within walking distance of the exam center). Traffic has a nasty habit of happening at the most in-opportune moments.

Now…as for the tricks:

1. TAKE YOUR TIME. You have ~90 minutes for approximately 75 questions (for a Sec+ exam as an example).
2. SIMULATIONS: Do this! FLAG THE QUESTION FOR REVIEW! In the upper left corner of the screen is a yellow flag. It’s there for you to mark a question to go back to later. USE THIS TOOL as a time management tool. When you do the SIM, the clock goes away…meaning…you lose track of time. That is a bad thing on a timed exam. By flagging the SIM, you move it to the end of the exam…AFTER you have done the rest of the questions. PLEASE FLAG the SIMs and do them at the end. It will improve your time management….which is CRITICAL on these exams.
3. RTFQ: Read the FULL Question. Do not do the “skimming” of the question. Do not fall into the TL/DR (Too Long/Didn’t Read) trap that people who are “attached-to-their-smartphone-and-only-read-140-characters-or-less” always seem to do. YOU HAVE TO READ THE WHOLE QUESTION….INCLUDING ALL of the answers.
4. Ask yourself “WHAT are they asking me?” If the question is about a network, then the answer is PROBABLY going to be a NETWORK answer….duh!
5. If you spend more than a minute or so on a question “staring at the screen”, FLAG IT and move on. The engine is going to ask you at the end about the flagged questions anyway. Think TIME MANAGMENT.
6. If your gut is SCREAMING AT YOU that it is “C”, there is a good probability that it is “C”If you “think” the answer is “B” but you are not sure, mark “B” —-AND—- FLAG the question. There might be a later question during the exam that will confirm your “think”.
7. RE-READ ALL of the FLAGGED questions at the end ALL THE WAY THRU and ask yourself again “WHAT are they asking me?”
8. Once you are done (as in DONE-DONE) and you get ready to submit the exam, your first instinct is going to be “I F&(%ed that up!”…that is NORMAL to feel that….
